So I created this blog to show the world the pictures I take (instead of keeping them inside obscure folders on my computer).

No editing. No cropping. So you're gonna find some surprises. Tilted pictures! Yaay!

That simple. They're simple. That's where the name of the blog comes from.

I hope it's of your liking!

PS: Just so you know who I am! Not a big fan of getting pictures taken of me. Also, this is not gonna be a blog with pics of me, but pics taken by me! I like it better.

Thanks!
